/**
 * Runs user-supplied code against each record inside an isolated {@link Sandbox}.
 *
 * <p>A custom transform today means writing Java, building a JAR, getting it onto every worker's
 * {@code plugin.path}, and restarting the workers -- and on a managed Connect service it is not
 * possible at all. This transform takes the logic as <em>configuration</em> instead: a path to a
 * WebAssembly module, or an image to run, in the connector config like any other SMT setting. The
 * guest can be written in any language that compiles to one of those targets.
 *
 * <p>An isolation boundary is what makes that shape workable, not a security fix. Kafka's trust
 * position is unchanged and this plugin does not alter it: transforms execute in the worker JVM
 * with its privileges, and installing one is an act of trust. That applies to this plugin's own
 * JAR exactly as it does to any other. What changes is the guest: it runs behind
 * {@link Sandbox} rather than as more privileged Java on the class path, so taking it as
 * configuration is a reasonable thing to do rather than a way of handing the worker to whoever
 * wrote the config. The strength of that boundary is a property of the provider in use, which is
 * why {@link SandboxCapabilities} is declared per provider rather than claimed once here.
 *
 * <p>Configure it like any other SMT:
 * <pre>
 * transforms=redact
 * transforms.redact.type=dev.islo.kafka.connect.sandbox.SandboxTransform
 * transforms.redact.sandbox.provider=wasm
 * transforms.redact.sandbox.module=/opt/transforms/redact.wasm
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Errors are deliberately split in two so that Connect's existing machinery keeps working. A
 * record the guest rejects raises {@link DataException}; a broken boundary raises
 * {@link SandboxException}. What Connect then does with either depends on the connector's
 * {@code errors.tolerance}, and on whether it is a sink or a source:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>With the default {@code errors.tolerance=none}, both fail the task.</li>
 *   <li>With {@code errors.tolerance=all}, both are tolerated and the record is skipped. Connect
 *       classifies tolerable exceptions by stage, not by type, so a {@link SandboxException} from
 *       a broken boundary is swallowed just as a {@link DataException} is. An operator who wants
 *       bad records skipped but a broken sandbox to stop the task cannot express that through
 *       {@code errors.tolerance} alone.</li>
 *   <li>The dead-letter queue applies to <b>sink connectors only</b>. {@code Worker} installs a
 *       {@code DeadLetterQueueReporter} for sink tasks and only a {@code LogReporter} for source
 *       tasks, and the {@code errors.deadletterqueue.*} properties are defined on
 *       {@code SinkConnectorConfig} alone. On a source connector a rejected record is logged and
 *       dropped, never captured.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note also that the dead-letter queue records the message as it arrived, before this
 * transform ran. For a redaction transform that means the DLQ holds the unmasked original.
 *
 * <p>Tombstones pass through untouched: there is no value to transform, and dropping them would
 * break compaction semantics for downstream consumers.
