/**
 * An isolated execution boundary that transforms one encoded record at a time.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole vendor-neutral contract. A runtime receives an opaque request payload,
 * executes untrusted user code against it inside whatever isolation boundary it provides, and
 * returns an opaque response payload. It knows nothing about Kafka Connect, and Connect knows
 * nothing about how the isolation is achieved.
 *
 * <p><b>Cost model.</b> {@link org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Transformation#apply} is
 * per-record and synchronous, so exactly one {@link #call(byte[])} happens per record. There is
 * no batching available at this layer. Implementations are therefore judged on round-trip
 * latency, not throughput: a runtime costing 50us per record caps a task at ~20k records/s.
 *
 * <p><b>Threading.</b> {@code Transformation.apply} must be thread-safe, but implementations of
 * this interface need not be: {@link SandboxTransform} serialises all calls. Implementations
 * must still tolerate {@link #close()} racing with an in-flight {@link #call(byte[])}.
