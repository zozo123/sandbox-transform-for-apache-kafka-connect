 * One kind of sandbox. Providers are discovered through {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.

 * <p>This is the extension point, and the point of the project. A sandbox is an interchangeable
 * thing: WebAssembly in the worker JVM and a microVM on the host are the same idea at wildly
 * different points on the isolation-versus-cost curve, and which one a pipeline wants is an
 * operational decision, not an architectural one. A third party ships a JAR with a new provider
 * and it becomes selectable by name with no change here.
 *
 * <p>Register implementations in
 * {@code META-INF/services/dev.islo.kafka.connect.sandbox.SandboxProvider}.
