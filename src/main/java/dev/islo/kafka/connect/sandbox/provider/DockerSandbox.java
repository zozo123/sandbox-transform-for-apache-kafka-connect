/**
 * Runs the guest inside a container or a virtual machine, through the Docker Engine API.
 *
 * <p>One implementation serves two very different boundaries, because the difference is which
 * engine it is pointed at rather than how it is driven. Left alone it uses the ambient Docker
 * socket and the guest gets namespaces and cgroups on the host's kernel. Pointed at a
 * microVM-backed engine -- Docker Sandboxes exposes one at {@code ~/.sbx/run/d/docker.sock} -- the
 * guest gets its own kernel and its own scheduler, and {@code --cpus} becomes a hardware vCPU
 * allocation rather than a share of host time. That is what makes an enforced CPU bound possible,
 * which is the one guarantee the WebAssembly provider cannot offer.
 *
 * <p>It shells out to the {@code docker} binary rather than speaking the Engine API over its unix
 * socket directly. That keeps the artifact at Java 11, so it still loads on Connect 3.x workers --
 * {@code SocketChannel} gained unix-domain support only in Java 16 -- and it adds no dependency to
 * a Connect plugin classloader. Nothing is bundled: whatever {@code docker} is on PATH is used.
