/**
 * Signals that the isolation boundary failed, as opposed to the record being bad.
 *
 * <p>This deliberately extends {@link ConnectException} rather than
 * {@link org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException}: a broken sandbox is a task-level fault,
 * whereas a record the guest rejected is a record-level fault that {@code errors.tolerance}
 * absorbs.
 *
 * <p>The distinction is real but Connect does not act on it as cleanly as the two types suggest.
 * Tolerance is decided by stage rather than by exception type, so {@code errors.tolerance=all}
 * skips the record for either. The type matters for what a reader of the logs and the DLQ sees,
 * and for the default {@code errors.tolerance=none}, where both fail the task. See
 * {@link SandboxTransform} for the full table, including the fact that the dead letter queue
 * exists for sink tasks only.
