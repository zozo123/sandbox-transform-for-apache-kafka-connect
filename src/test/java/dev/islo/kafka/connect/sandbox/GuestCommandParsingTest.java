/**
 * Pins how {@code sandbox.command} is parsed, because the answer is surprising and silent.
 *
 * <p>Kafka parses a {@code ConfigDef.Type.LIST} by splitting on every comma, with no quoting and
 * no escape. An inline guest script -- the obvious thing to reach for when trying a runtime out --
 * is full of commas, so it does not arrive at the guest mangled or rejected: it arrives as a dozen
 * separate argv entries, and the process launches with nonsense. Nothing in Connect warns about
 * it.
 *
 * <p>These tests do not change that behaviour; changing it would mean leaving {@code ConfigDef}
 * behind. They exist so the limitation is written down somewhere that fails when it stops being
 * true, and so the documentation on {@code COMMAND_CONFIG} has something backing it.
